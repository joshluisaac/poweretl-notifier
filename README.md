## Build
Building the project will download the required dependencies, assemble the artefact into a build structure and generate a zip file for deployment. Execute __rebuild.sh__ to accomplish this. The build zip file can be found at the project root directory with a timestamp naming convention.  

The naming convention uses the format `poweretl-notifier_%Y%m%d_%H%M%S.zip`
